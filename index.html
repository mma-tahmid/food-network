        <h1> My Recipies </h1>
        <p> The recipe should have
            directions for how to
            prepare it. The steps need
            to be listed in the order
            they should be done.
            Numbered steps are easy
            to follow & help to prevent
            steps from being skipped.
            However, some recipes are
            written in paragraph form,
            and should be read &
            followed VERY carefully. </p>

                <p>This is a great recipe for a slightly exotic flavor of Indian inspiration with a maple twist. The
                    flavor is exceptional, delicious, and unique. Orange zest may be added for an extra flavor twist.

                <p>Spicy and flavorful vegan korma made in an Instant Pot®. There is a bit of preparation as with
                    any korma, but cooking time is reduced, which helps free up time in the kitchen as well as
                    saving the integrity of the ingredients.
